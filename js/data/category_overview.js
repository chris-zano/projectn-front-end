                        `Though God wants us to go to all nations to preach the gospel, He commanded that we disciple them when we win them. This suggests that winning souls Is not enough. Those souls must be discipled to conform to the image of Christ.\n\nThis second part of the great commission is as crucial as the first part. This is because the end goal is not just to get the nations to be born again. The end goal is that nations, people, and tribes won and brought into the kingdom must also think, talk and live like Christ. The kingdom of our God is a kingdom for Christ-kind.\n\nToday, the church is made up of mixed multitudes because we have not taken our time to disciple every soul. Hence, the lifestyle of some Christians is not able to compel others to desire Jesus.\n\nDiscipleship is important to every believer if we are going to live the greater and superior life, which is in Christ Jesus.`,

                        'You see, discipleship creates an opportunity for a new believer to learn systematically and grow well. A pure understanding of the Christian faith is built in the new believer and in this way, he/she will do all things in Christ with understanding.\n\nFurther, you will agree with me that until new believers are raised properly or discipled they will always struggle to defend the faith. Some Christians simply do not understand why we partake in a communion service and its value. Such will partake in the communion of our Lord Jesus as a ritual. Neither will they be confident to talk about it or defend it when the need arises.\n\nWhen a new believer is properly discipled that he/she will feel confident to share the gospel. Today, many identify with the Christian faith and yet they are not bold to present what they believe. Why is it so? They have not been discipled well enough to wield the message of the gospel and to demonstrate its power.\n\nOne beautiful blessing of the Christian life is that it is a life of abundance. A life that produces results. It is a life that is fruitful; that multiplies, replenishes and also subdues. This life is glorious. Unfortunately, until a new believer is properly discipled she/he cannot bring forth this life. It will look like the gospel is a scam – it does not produce in us what it promises. But that is not the case. Further, this is the time God is raising a new generation of an end-time army to enforce the mind of God in these last days. If we are going to be part of God’s end-time force, we need to be properly disciple.\n\nChristianity is a way of being – God’s way of Being. Discipleship assists the believer to unlearn his old way of being to imbibe the divine way of being. Jesus made it clear to us that we cannot put a new wine into an old wineskin. The old wineskin will not be able to hold the new wine for long. But when the new wine is poured into a new wineskin, Jesus said both will be preserved (Matthew 9:17). Glory to God!',

The law works. As Christians, we can’t just resort to prayer and going to church whiles our lives are disordered. For instance, you can’t just live your life without a plan. A Christian must learn to plan his day, week and month. And having planned them, you commit them to God (Psalm 37:5) who will establish them.\n\nLaziness also is a disorder (2 Thes 3:11).

                    'message':
                        'To the end-time Church,\n\nWhy is it that suddenly you are so confused about tithing? Are there not enough provisions in the Word of God to guide the Church in all matters? Is it that you are so porous with the Word of God, such that you cannot determine what the will of God is?\n\nSometimes God\'s people find themselves in a dilemma, not because the scripture is not clear, but because we want the scripture to mean differently. Hence any wind of doctrine that may sound like what we have been wanting is a revelation. Should not revelations be subject to the consistency and coherence of scriptural provisions?\n\nSome believers have questioned the place of tithing in the New Testament, primarily because they wished it was not scriptural. Others are genuinely looking for answers because, for centuries, the blessings of the tithe preached for years have been elusive.\n\nNow, know and understand this - the holy Bible is made up of the Law and the Prophets, and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. The law operates by works (Romans 9:32) whiles grace works by faith (Ephesians 2:8). The law was given, so it might point us to seek grace which comes by faith. Therefore Jesus said to Martha, "Did I not tell you that if you will believe you should see the glory of God?" (John 11:40). Thus, it is faith that brings about the manifestation of what we know (without doubt) are real, done or accomplished by God for us. This is why one of the laws that govern faith says faith calls those things that are not as though they were (Romans 4:17). It was faith when God instructed Abram to start letting people call him Abraham (father of many) when he had no child. God was teaching him to call those things which be not as though they were. This is how Abraham caused God\'s word to become flesh in his life. So then, faith admits what God has said as real (or reckons the Word), places confidence in God\'s word and walks in conformity to this Word.\n\nLook at this - before the law was given through Moses, men walked with God by faith and thereby they enjoyed grace. Abraham believed and it was counted unto him for righteousness (Romans 4:3). This is the grace of God.\n\nJesus, answering the Pharisees about the sabbath and how his disciples are blameless in breaking it, used David (who ate the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat) and the priests in the temple (who profaned the sabbath and were blameless) as a case study of how men in the era of the law lived in grace (Matthew 12:2-5). \n\nWhen it comes to tithing let us not forget that before the law was given men of faith tithed. Abraham was the first to be noted in the Bible to tithe (Genesis 14). The second instance of tithing by faith is recorded when Jacob was leaving his father\'s house to Laban\'s place. Even though Isaac is not mentioned to have tithe, there is no way Jacob could have known of tithing but through his father Isaac. So, it can be confidently said that the patriarchs of our faith tithed. What we need to know or understand is how these men of faith tithed.\n\nUnder the law the principle is different. Whereas faith calls those things that be not or reckons the unseen as real and walks in it, the law sees to believe (even though we can only believe what is unseen). Another characteristic of the law is that it operates on works and reward system. Thus, you obey and you are rewarded. Under grace, you obey because you have (according to the free gift of God) what it takes to.   (Compare Exodus 19:5 and 1 Peter 2:9).\n\nWhen it comes to tithing this fact must be clear - the patriarchs tithed by faith and in the time of the law, men tithed by law. Under the law, tithing came with its own rules and regulations and guaranteed blessings if it is adhered to (Malachi 3:10-11). Thus, you are not blessed. However, if you bring the tithe into the storehouse of the Lord, then he will pour out a blessing that you will not have enough room to contain. this was the outlook of tithing under the law.\n\nHow about the Church in the dispensation of grace? How is the Church supposed to tithe? Simple, by faith which produces grace.\n\nTo understand how the Church is to tithe in the dispensation of grace, we must first appreciate how the men of faith tithed and then align it with the finished works of Jesus Christ. Look at this:\n\nAbraham went to war against a confederate of four kingdoms (Genesis 14:1). These kings came up against five kingdoms of which Sodom was a part (Genesis 14:2). These five kingdoms were defeated by the four, and Lot, Abraham’s nephew was taken among the captives (Genesis 14:11-12). Abraham heard of the plight of his nephew and quickly mobilized forces of his own servants, 300 men to fight and rescue his nephew out of the hands of these four kingdoms (Genesis 14:14-15). God gave victory to Abraham, even with that small number of armed servants. He brought back all the captives with the spoil these four kings took from the five kingdoms (Genesis 14:16).\n\nNow, it is recorded that Melchizedek, king of Salem went out to meet Abraham. This Melchizedek was a king but also a priest at the same time (Genesis 14:18). This is strange because the priesthood had always been separated from the kingship except in the case of Jesus Christ who received both. This priest of the Most High God blessed Abraham (then called Abram). After blessing Abraham, he gave the priest of the Most High God the tithes of all (Genesis 14:19-20). Why?\n\nFirst, Abraham had victory only God could give him. When Melchizedek blessed him, he reminded Abraham of the Most High God who has delivered his enemies into his hands. Signifying that even though he and his servants fought, the victory was of the Lord. Therefore Abraham gave the tithe in recognition or in affirmation of the fact that God made his victory possible. "Then shall you remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power (idea, vehicle, opportunity, network, strength) to create wealth as it is this day (Deuteronomy 8:18).\n\nThe new believer\'s tithe is first to recognize (or remembrance of) the Lord who has blessed him with strength, ideas, opportunities and networks to create wealth. The tithe is our recognition of God, as our Jehovah Jireh) or our faith in Him as our provider. Don’t forget this - the blessing preceded the tithe.\n\nFurther, we need to note that by reason of the finished works of Christ on the cross, there is no way the tithe can bless a believer. If the tithe could bless there would be no need for the grace of our Lord Jesus in 2 Corinthians 8:9. The men of faith tithed in recognition of the God whose blessings have enabled them to create wealth. So then, it is the one who believes that he is already blessed by the grace of our Lord Jesus\' impoverishment, and that he is creating wealth day-by-day by this grace, who tithes as a token of his faith. After all, faith without works is dead. What we believe within must always have an outward action. The tithe is our token of faith in the finished works of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nLet\'s look at Jacob\'s tithing. Jacob was fleeing from his brother Esau and he came to Bethel. God spoke to him that He will be with him and keep him in all places that he goes. God assured him that He will fulfil His promises in him. (Genesis 28:13-15). Jacob woke up and made a vow saying:\n\nIf God will be with me, and will keep me in the way that I go;And will give me bread to eat, And raiment to put on; So that I come again to my father\'s house in peace; Then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set for a pillar shall be God\'s house. And of all that you shall give me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee.(Genesis 28:20-22)\n\nJacob was empty-handed fleeing from his brother, but he recognized that if he will come back to his father’s house with something in his hands it will be of God. No wonder God gave Jacob visions and ideas to soar above the schemes and manipulations of his uncle (Genesis 31:9-12).\n\nPrecious One, it may be natural to eat but it is divine to digest. It may be natural to you to work but it is divine to be paid. It is the believer who remembers his God and demonstrates faith in the finished works of our Lord Jesus, that though He was rich yet He became poor for riches, that tithes. Such a one will abound more and more in the same financial grace that oozes out of the finished works of Christ.\n\nTithing is of God, and our Lord Jesus is after the order of Melchizedek.\n\nTithing by law will yield no results because we are not under the law.\n\nTithing to the Church is futile because the Church is not your provider, God is. I hear many say often – I paid my tithe to the church. The tithe is not paid, it is given. The tithe is not paid to the Church, it is given to the Lord. The Church only receives it on the behalf of the Lord.\n\nShould the tithe be strictly the tenth?\n\nThe law restricted the tithe to 10% of what every man realizes. In the dispensation of grace, when the tithe is our remembrance of God (or gratitude) and His financial grace upon our lives I will say let your faith guide you. Somebody may be more thankful than the other. Another may be more appreciative than the other. It will all depend on your faith in Christ and his finished works for you.\n\nTithing by faith is the key by which the Church can abound more and more in Christ’s finished works.\n\nGrace be with you all.',

                        "To the End-Time Church,\n\nJesus is coming again. His return is imminent. If there was ever a time the gospel needed to be preached fiercely, it is now. If there was a time God's power is needed to advance the gospel, it is now. And if there was a time money is needed to advance the course of Christ to the ends of the world, it is now. Then what is God waiting for? \n\nThere is a phenomenon in the church today that is not of God. It is this - some believers have been raised to think that Christianity is all about getting money, cars, husbands and wives, properties, scholarships, etc. This is what they have been taught to call BLESSINGS. Their prayer lives and dispositions are focused on getting these 'blessings' from God. What is surprising is that these blessings seem not to be coming and they never stop to ask why.\n\nUntil God's people choose to understand the ways of God, there's no way we can force our ways on Him. Most often, it is as though we choose or assume an approach and then think we can be successful with God by that approach. This is why this generation seems to be praying much but there are fewer results. We want much from God and little is delivered into our hands.\n\nPrecious One, Christianity is not materialism. It is about living the abundant life; the life of God. This life is given to us to be a solution to the hurting and the desperate, the struggling and the confused, perplexed and the disenfranchised (Psalms 82:1-6). We have been saved to be saviors to others. We have been delivered to be deliverers to others (Obadiah 1:21). Is this not the 'end' God wants to see our lives portray?\n\nIf this is what God wants our lives to portray, then, we quickly understand that money, husbands, or wives, vineyards, houses, and all that we call blessings are only 'means' to enable us to realize the 'end'. Thus, you need money to be a deliverer to the poor. You need a companion to multiply efforts to realize the greater destiny which can and must be yours. What we call blessings are rather resources to fulfil the plan of God for our lives.\n\nNo child of God can receive anything (means) from God until he is clear with God what he/ she intends to achieve (end) with that thing. Fortunately, God is a God of purpose. He does nothing for doing sake. Neither will He bless a man for blessing's sake. He said to Abraham that He will bless him to make him a blessing. Thus, He [God] will give him [Abraham] a lot of blessings as a resource to enable him to transform the lives of others (Genesis 12:2). Precious One, there is always a reason for what God does, and there has to be a reason why God must give you access to your blessings in Him.\n\nThen you may ask - is not every believer already blessed in Christ (Galatians 3:9)? Are we not the seed of Abraham, and therefore heir according to the promise (Galatians 3:29)? Truly, we are blessed with faithful Abraham. Then why do believers pray to be blessed again, being already blessed with faithful Abraham?\n\nOften, when some believers are asking God to bless them what they are saying without realizing is that God should help them manifest the blessedness of God in their lives. It is the manifestation they are referring to in the actual sense. Most Christians only consider what they see as real. So, they don't see themselves blessed until they see their bank balance go up. However, when Jesus cried, 'it is finished' on the cross (John 19:30), everything that pertains to the superior life and godliness was paid for mankind. The abundant life became possible such that whoever believes (even if he has no physical evidence to prove it) shall realize it.\n\nBehold this – If believers will appreciate the finished works of Christ on the cross, we would also recognize that we are already blessed (Galatians 3:9; Genesis 1:28). If a man is blessed what will be the one proof that will convince all including the devil? His verbosity? Definitely not.\n\nThe blessed man is the one who takes five loaves of bread and two fishes and instead of thinking that is not enough, he lifts them and gives thanks. Knowing that he is blessed, and that anything in his hands can multiply, with confidence he steps out to help others who are struggling and confused, hurting and desperate. He uses what is in his hands to feed 5000 men. Precious one, it is the one who can be a blessing with the little in his hands, who will have access to more of his blessings in Christ Jesus.\n\nIs it not written concerning the widow who came to Elisha because her two sons were being taken away from her to be slaves due to debt, how Elisha told her to go and borrow empty vessels and then pour out her little oil into the empty vessels? As long as the oil was flowing from vessel to vessel the oil never ceased. It only ceased when there was no empty vessel to pour into (2 Kings 4:3-6). Until God's people shift focus from themselves to others who need help [or need to be blessed], the blessings of the Lord will not flow. Until we start pouring ourselves into others, the little water will not become a fountain, and the fountain will not become a stream. The stream will not become an ocean until we choose to focus on being a blessing.\n\nThis is why Jesus said we should seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and every other thing shall be added unto us (Matthew 6:33). Precious One, what are you seeking? A means or an end? The end should be the focus, and the means will flow through us. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose hearts are perfect towards Him (2 Chronicles 16:9). How can a man's heart be perfect? When he steers away from self-centeredness and chooses to affect or impact other lives positively.\n\nIf ‘means’ are not ‘ends’ in themselves then it is time the Church redefines its priorities, focus and goal.\n\nJesus showed us the two greatest commandments - you shall love the Lord with all your heart, soul and mind... and you shall love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-40). The church's priority should be to use all our means to love God and also to show the kindness of God to our neighbors. The end-time believer should pause and ask himself/herself - what can I do for God and my neighbors? If you find the answer to this question, God's means will start flowing to you and through you.\n\nThe world needs saviors; the nations need deliverers. Can the church seize this opportunity to be a blessing that the blessings of God might flow through her?\n\nGrace and peace be multiplied unto the Church forevermore.",

                        "To the Church in the Last Days,\n\nDo not lose sight so easily, that the coming of our Lord Jesus is here. It is unfortunate that the church that used to believe and hold dear the second advent of our Lord, before the turn of the millennium, has gone back to sleep. Was it because we earnestly looked forward to His coming, or the news at that time that every 2000 years something happens, drove the church to such earnestness?\n\nBefore the death and departure of our Lord Jesus Christ, He gave us signs to guide us in the last days. These signs are to be our guiding posts so we are not taken by surprise when the end is near. Have you also forgotten so soon what Apostle Paul said by the Spirit?\n\nFor yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as labour upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. (1 Thessalonians 5:2-3).\n\nOur Lord is coming as a thief in the night, indicating, not that He is coming stealthily but rather at a time when men are deeply asleep. The probability that God's people will be asleep at the appearance of our Lord Jesus is high. Shouldn't the church continuously assess herself to see if she is still in the faith? Should the church not prove herself at such a time like this? (2 Corinthians 13:5).\n\nDid not our Lord tell us ahead of time that we should take heed that no man deceive us, when the disciples questioned Him of the signs of His coming and the end of the world? (Matthew 24:4).\n\nSignaling that the possibility of his disciples being deceived in the last days is there. And this deception will come through spiritual leaders who will claim to hold certain mysteries of the kingdom. They will parade all forms of doctrines and mysteries, sounding very spiritual. From such people flee. The mystery of the kingdom has been revealed or made known (Romans 16:25-26) in the person of Christ and His bride, the Church (Ephesians 3:9-11).\n\nThe serpent is wise, therefore our Lord admonished that we should be wise as serpents (Matthew 10:16). To make his work easier, he is employing multiple strategies so he might deceive many in these last days. He is aware that many of God's children do not have what it takes to endure economic hardship. Therefore he is employing difficult times as a means to wane the faith of the Church. Then, amid economic hardships, he is sending forth his ministers whose job is to be wolves in sheepskins, bringing distortion and deception to the church.\n\nToday, the church has no clarity on God's true position on divorce and remarriage. But the devil’s strategy is clear, focusing on this - adulterers shall not enter into the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9).\n\nThe one who remarries wrongly will find himself on the side of adulterers. Such shall not inherit the kingdom of God no matter what else he does for God. On that day, our Lord shall look at him/her and shall say to such a one - get thee behind me; I do not know you. Which many shall exclaim - but Lord we did this in your name and that in your name (Matthew 7:22-23).\n\nPrecious One, in these last days economic hardship has made it easy for fornication to thrive among God's people. The lying tongue, gambling and idolatry (idolizing money) have crept into the lives of believers.\n\nThere are many in the church today that are living unholy lives because they want to survive. We crucify our Lord afresh each day. But the saying remains true, that if you cannot survive with the help of your God, then your God is not worth following. We should not lose sight of the fact, that the children of Israel were redeemed from the grip of Egypt after 400 years. In their redemption, they had to wander in the Wilderness for forty years and their survival was of God. For forty years, they never sowed or reaped and yet God fed and blessed them in the wilderness (Deuteronomy 2:7). Is the end time Church lacking faith? Do you lack faith too, that you have to cut corners to make a living?\n\nOne thing is fearful, and the church must be aware. Our brother John, by the Spirit, wrote to the Church concerning what shall come to pass in the last days in his Revelation letters; the things which are expedient that the Church takes note of and prepare towards.\n\nHe mentioned that in the last days there shall come a one called THE GREAT WHORE who sits upon many waters (Revelations 17:1).\n\nSuch a woman, the kings of the earth will commit fornication with, and the inhabitants of the earth shall be made drunk with the wine of her fornication (Revelations 17:2).\n\nRemember this, that such a woman is not a person. Such a woman is an industry - the pornographic industry. Such that many shall be made intoxicated with her wine of fornication.\n\nThus, fornication will become a lifestyle many will patronize. Today, nudity is the new wave. Social media, and anything electronic media, are now infested with shameless nudity and pornography. This has engendered a generation of young people who constantly have sex on their minds. They spend dozens of hours online looking for nudity to consume. Prostitution has become too easy to practice and fornication abounds in every corner.\n\nI said earlier that this is fearful, because to be drunk or intoxicated with the wine of fornication of this GREAT WHORE is to be addicted to that which will be difficult to break free.\n\nIt will not only involve the youth but also kings or leaders who will be so gripped by the wine of fornication or pornography, such that homes will be broken, and responsible leadership will be lost. In a man's drunkenness, can he be alert, steady and in control? If not, then men shall be infested with the spirit of pornography and nudity, and uncontrolled sexual desires. And this I say, knowing how God's people will be tempted. No one will be exempted from this temptation - church leaders, church workers, church financiers, church members and all. The question remains - Who will stand?\n\nThe book of Daniel has a key that the Church can use for results at such a time like this – “…but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action” (Daniel 11:32). Not taking action is taking the wrong action. As children of God, is it not the time to bury ourselves in the Word of God? Is it not the word you know and have imbibed that will correct, counsel, rebuke or make a way for you in the day of temptation? Is it not the time to deepen our fellowship with the Holy Spirit of God, the One who guides us into all truths? Precious One, is it not our busy lives that have made our communion (both with the Word and in prayer with the Holy Spirit) less? Less communion with the Word and the Spirit will make us vulnerable to the schemes and wiles of the devil in the day of adversity.\n\nThis is the time for the Church to return to the ministry of the unadulterated Word and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost.\n\nIn the Word is light and this light shines in the darkness and the darkness cannot stand it (John 1:4). Where the Word abides, the desires of the flesh vacate, and liberty is produced. How shall we guard our hearts with all diligence (Proverbs 4:23)? It can only be by adhering to the instructions of the unadulterated Word and the leadership of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe who finds himself/herself in this drunkenness – WAKE UP\n\nHe who is tempted to drink from the cup of this GREAT WHORE – RECEIVE GRACE TO FOREBEAR\n\nBut He that is naïve – RECEIVE UNDERSTANDING because the days are evil.\n\nGrace and peace will continue to multiply to the Church through the knowledge of our Lord Jesus. He will build His Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against (impede, hold back) her advancement.\n\nStrength and peace to the Church, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus.

The word of God comes in two forms – the written word (or the letter) and the spirit-word (2 Corinthians 3:6). The written word, Paul by the Spirit, says kills but the spirit-word gives life. The letter is only necessary as a container or cloak for the spirit-word. The written word makes it possible for the spirit-word to be packaged into a Bible. The spirit-word is the active word of God or the spoken word of God. The spirit-word is also the original intent or mind of God embedded in what He has spoken. He that stops at the letter will reap the whirlwind. This is because it is the spirit-word that gives life (John 6:63).\n\nPrecious One, it is the active word of God that produces faith in the heart of the hearer. This is the word of faith which we preach. It is this word of faith that brought a change in our hearts, turning us unto God the day we heard the gospel.\n\nThe word of faith can come to us in various forms but to the same destination – our spirit. For instance, you can go to pray and God’s word of faith can come to you in the form of peace in your heart. There and then you know that God has answered your prayer. It can also be that you picked your Bible to read, and as you were reading a couple of passages, a phrase or a word jumped up in your spirit or cling to your heart. This is the word of faith. Other times it can come in the form of knowing. You just know with certainty and yet no one told you. I tell people that you can feel hungry, it is alright. You can feel a headache, it is natural. However, if you feel a message; you just know something is going to happen – it is not ordinary. It is the voice of God to you, so take it as such. When you receive a word of faith put it to work. It will produce the results it talks about. Glory to Jesus.",

He only needs to acknowledge that, at least. he has one of the nine manifestations (1 Corinthians 12:8-10).  It is the Spirit, who dwells in us, who distributes to us these gifts. He chooses for us which of the gifts we should manifest (1 Corinthians 12:11), and this manifestation is supernatural.

In other words, there is a Spirit behind the God-kind of faith. It is this Spirit who works in us both to will and to do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13). When you heard the gospel for the first time, it was the Spirit of faith who used the word to ignite faith in you to believe in Him whom the Father has sent (John 6:29).\n\nIt is possible to read the Bible and not appreciate it. It is possible to hear a sermon and ridicule it. To the natural man the things of the Spirit are foolish (1 Corinthians 2:14). Yet to us who have the Spirit of faith, it is wisdom. Glory to God.\n\nAn incident is mentioned in the book of Samuel. Saul was going to be made king. As a result, Samuel (the prophet) anointed him in private with oil (1 Samuel 10:1). Later on, Samuel (the prophet) met with the elders of the tribes of Israel in Mizpah, to cast a lot in choosing who will be king over Israel (1 Samuel 10:17). He made all the tribes to pass before him and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen (1 Samuel 10:20). After, he made all the families of Benjamin pass before him and the family of Matri was chosen (1 Samuel 10:21) and out of this family Saul (the son of Kish) was chosen. They looked for Saul and he was nowhere to be found. Saul was afraid of the whole idea that he is going to be king over God's people so he went hiding. Being king over God’s inheritance is an enormous responsibility. When he was later found (1 Samuel 10:23), Samuel (the prophet) presented him to Israel (1 Samuel 10:24). When Saul was presented to Israel, not everyone accepted him. Some questioned how this coward could save them from their enemies (1 Samuel 10:27).\n\nBut something interesting happened. Nahash, king of Ammon, attacked Jabeshgilead (a city in the land of Gilead in the half-tribe of Manasseh, on the other side of the Jordan). The people of Jabeshgilead requested a memorandum of understanding between them and Nahash king of Ammon, to serve him (1 Samuel 11:1). Nahash's terms of the agreement included putting out everyone's right eye, making it a disgrace upon all Israel (1 Samuel 11:2). The people of Jabesh Gilead could not succumb to this. Hence they requested 7 days grace period to see if they could find help. If not, then they will have no choice but to submit themselves to the terms (1 Samuel 11:3).\n\nNow, this is what happened. The people of Jabeshgilead sent messengers throughout Israel for help to ward off Nahash but they found none until they came to Gibeah, the city of Saul (1 Samuel 11:4-5). They narrated the situation they find themselves in, and it is recorded that the people of Gibeah wailed for them. Thus the best they could do for their brothers in Jabeshgilead is to wail. At the time the people of Gibeah were wailing for their brothers, Saul had just returned from the field. Upon hearing the plight of the people of Jabeshgilead, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and his anger was aroused (1 Samuel 11:6). He took his father's oxen and slaughtered it, cutting it into pieces and with those pieces, he sent them throughout entire Israel with a message - '…this is what shall be done to the oxen of the one who does not come after Saul and Samuel to war” (1 Samuel 11:7).\n\n1. Interestingly, his message stirred up the people to follow him. This is something you should take note of. By his word 330,000 men gathered unto him (1 Samuel 11:8). This is the man who was questioned whether he can save Israel from her enemies.\n2. Secondly Saul issued a statement of faith. He commanded the messengers of Jabeshgilead to return home. When they arrive, they are to inform the elders of the city that tomorrow about the time the sun is at its peak and hot, help would have arrived. I love this. Saul gave them time and assured them of the help they are looking for. This boldness/ confidence in the day of adversity can only be by the Spirit of faith.\nPrecious One, the Spirit of faith is the Holy Spirit of God whom we have received. He is the doer of the word of God, the mind and plans of God. He works to produce in us the faith we need, to work the works of God.  You also, having the same Spirit of faith according as it is written, 'I believed and therefore have I spoke', choose to believe the word of God today and speak it forth. The Holy Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of Faith, will take your words and turn them into extraordinary results. Glory to Jesus!",

                    'message': "“Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouth of lions,…” (Hebrews 11:33)\n\nThe God-kind of faith is powerful, such that if a man lives his life in the faith realm, he can only produce extraordinary results. By faith, men and women have accomplished seemingly impossible feats.\n\n1. By faith Abel offered unto God an excellent sacrifice (Hebrews 11:4). By this faith he was commended as righteous when God approved of his sacrifice.\n2. By faith Enoch was lifted from this life and he was taken up into heaven. He never had to experience death because God promoted him. However, before he was taken up into heaven he was counted as a man whose lifestyle of faith pleased God (Hebrews 11:5). Precious One, without faith it’s impossible to please God.\n3. By faith Noah believed in God’s word that a flood is coming and the end of mankind is at hand. By that same faith, he took action to warn the world of danger whiles preparing an ark to save himself and anyone who wanted to escape this judgment of God. Truly, the floods came, and Noah escaped with his family (Hebrews 11:7).\n4. By faith Abraham became a possessor of a country and a land that he was a foreigner in. For God had told him to leave his own country, family and people to a place that was not made known to him from the first day. By faith he obeyed and set out on this journey, believing that God is faithful and can be trusted. Because of this, God credited his faith to him as righteousness. (Hebrews 11:8)\n5. Sarah also achieved the impossible when she believed God to give her a son at an age her reproductive system was considered dead scientifically. She received the strength to conceive at the age of 90 years old. The God-kind of faith can prevail in the face of impossibilities.\nTime and space will not permit me to share the faith of others captured in Scripture. These men, through the power of faith, did wondrous things.\n\nBy faith, men conquered kingdoms, pursued righteousness, and shut the mouth of lions (Hebrews 11:33). They were able to put out the power of raging fire by their faith. In times of weakness, by their faith, they generated strength in themselves to do exploit (Hebrews 11:34). Glory to God!\n\nToday, there are men and women in many places across the world who are touching lives, changing the situations of their families, communities, and their nations by the God-kind of faith. The God-kind of faith produces results every time, anywhere in the world irrespective of the one who engaged it. This is why I know for sure that you can also change any situation if you can trust the word of God enough. Truly, God is faithful and can be trusted.",

                    'message': "If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God;... (1Peter 4:11)\n\nA careful study of the subject of faith reveals that faith has its language. This language reveals the perspective of faith at all times in every situation. Where you live will shape your perspectives in life and also the vocabulary you use day to day. It is the same with the faith dimension.\n\nAbraham is considered one of the pillars of our faith. Before Abraham built strong faith God had to teach him. One of the lessons Abraham had to learn is the language of faith. When Abraham (then Abram) was ninety-nine years old, God appeared unto him (Genesis 17:1). He spoke to Abraham about His covenant with him (Genesis 17:2) and how he will become the father of many nations (Genesis 17:4). Thus, God’s vision for Abraham was to make him the father of many nations. For this vision to be a reality, God told Abraham (then Abram – exalted father) to change his name from henceforth to Abraham (father of multitudes) in Genesis 17:5. Why?\n\nEarlier, God had said to Abraham that he will become the father of many nations (Genesis 17:4). The reason Abraham will become the father of many nations is that God has made him (or programmed him to be) a father of many nations (compare Genesis 17:5) before He told him. Thus, Abraham cannot manifest anything unless it is programmed in him spiritually. A car can do what it is programmed to do. A woman can conceive and give birth because she is programmed in that way. If Abraham will become, he must first be programmed. Spiritual programming is invisible but real. God does the spiritual programming, you have to do the manifestation of the programming.\n\nHow can one manifest God’s programming for his/her life?\n\nThis is where the language and the laws of faith come in. Until a man says the same thing as God has said, he cannot manifest it. If you have confidence in what God has programmed you to be, say you are.\n\nUntil you learn to say 'I am', there will never be a manifestation for others to say of you 'thou art'. If you trust what God has said about you, make it your reality by letting it reflect in your language.\n\nThis is why God, teaching Abraham the language of faith, said to him, “I have made you the father of many nations when there was no child in sight. If you [Abraham] trust Me, from today going forward call yourself, and also let people call you the father of many nations.” This was the key. A year by that same time Abraham gave birth to his son Isaac. Glory to God.\n\nPrecious One, the language of faith talks like God does. It is founded on this principle of faith – “calling those things which are not, as though they were” (Romans 4:17). If believers will search the scriptures they will find thousands of God’s statements regarding how He has programmed us. If we can trust what God has said, say the same thing as God has said and walk with confidence based on what God has said, we will be amazed at how glorious life in Christ is. For instance, God has said that, as part of the heritage of the servants of the Lord, He has programmed you in a way that no weapon formed or developed against you shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17). Suggesting that the weapon that can destroy you doesn’t exist and cannot exist except He [God], who programmed you creates one.  Until God’s people put their trust in this heritage, say the same thing as God has said, and confidently live their lives within the assurance of this truth, we will see human and demonic enterprise prevailing against us.\n\nLet us talk like God because we originate from God (1 John 4:4). Let us talk in alignment with What God has said and we will be speaking faith’s language. Glory to God.",

                    'message': "Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law, of works? Nay: but by the law of faith (Romans 3:27)\n\nThere are laws in the faith dimension. These laws must be carefully understood and applied to get results. I have heard many people say they had faith but that faith didn’t work for them. If faith doesn’t work then that faith had a problem. It may likely be that a law of faith was violated.\n\nFor instance, if we see faith as something we are expecting to happen it is not faith. It is hope. This is why some Christians say “I had faith but it never happened”. This statement reveals that this person hoped instead.\n\nUnderstanding the laws of faith is key to walking the faith life for results. Some of these laws of faith include, but not limited to:\n\nThe Law of Hearing: Faith begins with hearing (Romans 10:17). The God-kind of faith must have a foundation for it to work. This faith is not abstract. It is not about conditioning the mind. It is about what God has said, which you have heard. Remember this – it is one thing to read the word of God. It is another thing to hear him. It is one thing to listen to a sermon and it is another thing to hear God through the sermon. It is what you hear that engenders true faith. Simon Peter was in a boat with the other disciples and the storm was too strong for them. Then suddenly they saw a figure of a person walking on the sea towards them (Matthew 14:24-25). Such a scene will cause fear and panic so the disciples began to cry out of fear thinking that it is a ghost. Jesus assured them that it is Him so they should not be afraid (Matthew 14:26-27). Simon Peter requested that if it is truly Jesus walking on the water, He should instruct him Peter, or give him a word (to come to Him). I was thinking that if Peter needs to get out of the boat he didn’t need to be instructed, or? See, Peter wanted to also walk on water and he needed to hear, and hearing by the word of God. All that Jesus said was “Come” (Matthew 14:28-29). Just the word ‘come’ was enough to make Peter walk on water. Glory to God!\nPrecious One, one word from God can contain an entire life-changing formula. What you need first is to hear His word. How can I hear His word always?\n\nFor instance, many times I had read that scripture – ‘…no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper…’, and it meant nothing to me. I read it as a statement in the Bible until one morning I read it again. That morning I spent few minutes meditating on that statement God has made about me because of the second part of that same scripture – 'this is the heritage of the servants of God…’. Heritage means birthright and I wanted to understand this birthright. In meditation, I heard God (or received a different understanding) through that scripture saying, “if no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper then the weapon that can destroy you does not exist, right”? I said, yes Lord! From that day on I stopped being afraid of what man or the devil can do against me. Glory to God. The word birthed faith in me to disperse all my fears; giving me courage like never before.\n\nPrecious One, don’t just read scriptures and begin to run around that you have faith. Hear God through that scripture. Reading the letter (written word of God) is nothing because the letter kills but it is the spirit of the word of God that gives life.\n\nThe Law of Reckoning: Supposing you stepped out and in your mind you know you have just \$50 on you. You entered the mall and you wanted a pair of shoes, but it was priced at \$60. What would you do? You will naturally think that you can’t afford it so you will walk away. This is because you have accounted what you think you have against what you want to buy and concluded the money on you cannot offset the price of the shoe. Later on, you decided to check again the amount you have in your wallet/purse, only to realize that you have \$70 (\$50 + \$20). You remembered, that morning a friend gave you \$20 owed you. From that moment on, what will happen to you is that you will update your records (or account for the \$20) in terms of how much you are worth at that moment. The law of reckoning states that faith updates personal records, accounting for what God has said is your worth at every moment in time. Thus, always account it as so, what the word of God says it’s so (Romans 6:11). Faith account the invisible as real, usable and existing because God's Word said so. It is by the law of reckoning that you got saved. You confessed the Lordship of Jesus, trusting in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, even though you were not there when that happened. After, you reckoned that you are saved from all your sins even though nothing visible changed about you. You simply trusted the prescription God's Word gave to you - if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9). That trust brought peace into your heart. Why? This is because you reckoned that you are saved, having done what God says you should do to be saved. This is the law of reckoning. Often, when God’s people say they have faith, they fail to reckon the word of God upon which their faith is founded. \n\nThe Law of Speaking Out What is Believed: Faith cannot remain in your heart; it must be spoken out. Faith is bold. Faith is confident. But faith calls those things that are not as though they were. If you believe it, say it. You can't wait to see it before you say it. Faith spoken is not in the future; faith spoken is in the present or past. For instance, Jesus wanted to resurrect Lazarus from the grave so He stood to pray. Jesus knew that it is only by faith Lazarus can come back to life. His prayer was like this – Father, I thank You that You have heard me and I know that you always hear me. (John 11:41-42). Watch this – Even though He had not prayed He declared the conclusion or called it done even though Lazarus was inside the tomb. Jesus had come to the place where He knew by faith that God is with Him, and ever ready to honor His word. The same way Jesus has said about you, “…and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20).\nPrecious One, faith doesn’t say God is going to do it. It says God has done it. Faith doesn’t say goodness and mercies shall follow me. It says goodness and mercies are following me.\n\nFaith does not say I am poor or weak (because of the status of my bank account or how I am feeling). Faith says I am rich or strong because God said I should say so (Joel 3:10; 2 Corinthians 8:9). Do you want to see your health restored? Find out what God's word says (1 Peter 2:24). What do you hear God telling you through this scripture? Do you hear Him saying to you – I don’t see you sick because you were healed of this sickness on the cross? Can you believe Him that you were healed and that your symptoms cannot make you disbelieve God? Can you say the same thing that you have heard from God’s word with absolute confidence? If you have done all these, then rise up and walk because your faith has made you whole. Glory to God. Precious One, learn to say the same thing you hear God say to you. Let the word of God change your perspective and also your language. Call it done even though you have not seen it.\n\n1. Doubt and Fear are the Enemies of faith: Earlier, we mentioned that Peter walked on water after Jesus said to him to come. The incident did not end there. Whiles Peter was miraculously walking on the water he was focusing on Jesus and what He has said to him. Then something interesting happened. Even though Jesus had told Peter to come to Him by walking on the water, the storms were still strong; blowing against him. Incidents around you can make you have so many different pictures of an outcome. The storm against Peter began to shift his focus from what Jesus has said, to what the strong storm can do to him (Matthew 14:30-31). This shifting of focus is doubt. Doubt comes in many forms. One common way it comes to us is by that small voice – “what if…? What if…?” “What if” creates negative or opposing pictures in our minds and that is the time our faith begins to wane. Those pictures announce outcomes other than what God has said, the same way the devil told Eve a different outcome (Genesis 3:4-5). When a man considers or believes these outcomes other than the word of God, fear or doubt is generated. Precious One, create no room for ‘what if…” when God's word comes to you.\n2. The Law of Substitution: This law operates on the finished works of our Lord Jesus. Thus, a man convicted of a crime or evil can not be punished twice for that offence of crime (the law of double jeopardy). If Jesus suffered and died in our place, we cannot suffer again for it. Jesus is our substituted lamb. What Christ has paid for we are entitled to. Faith sees Jesus paid for our freedom, he declares himself freed (if it's been paid I have it). It is the conviction of faith that what Jesus has suffered he/she cannot suffer it again.\n3. Faith cannot Boast: The results the God-kind of faith produces are not the accomplishment of man’s effort but the workings of God’s word. Therefore what is accomplished by faith can only be to the glory of God. Further, no man can compare and boast of his faith against another man’s faith. We are what we are by the grace of God (1 Corinthians 15:10).",

                    'message': "Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience (James 1:3)\n\nPrecious one, your God-kind of faith will stand trial. Don’t make the mistake to think that faith will go unopposed. Your faith will stand trial. However, you must resolve to blaze through any opposition against your faith. There are many factors that will put your faith to the test. These factors will challenge the level of trust you have in the word of God. Many years ago I heard the story of a believer who was not well for a while. As a result, he could not fellowship with his church during that time. One day, he was studying the Bible and he came across the right word by which God spoke to him expressly that if only he will believe he will see the glory of God (John 11:40). To demonstrate his faith in the word of God, he rose up from his bed (though weak) to go to church. He has decided to fellowship with the brethren again. In pain and weakness, he made it to church. After service, everybody was glad to see this brethren again and the faith he is demonstrating. Many came to shake his hands and encourage him. Until one brother approached him and said, “It is amazing to see you today. This dawn I had a dream about you and you were dead”. Instantly, fear knocked at his door. He began to lose his joy, his resolve, his determination and all. When he sensed fear as a result of what the brother said, he remembered that fear is of the devil hence that dream cannot be of God. He turned to the brother and said, “I rebuke you devil, for it is written concerning me that I will not die but live to declare the goodness of God”. At that instance, the fear departed and he regained his composure and joy. After 21 days, this brother saw the healing he had believed. He was made whole without any drugs. Glory to God.\n\nThere are three common enemies of the God-kind of faith. These three enemies often will challenge your faith, trying it, to see how strong and enduring your faith is. These enemies are:\n\n1. Time: Time is the enemy of faith. Faith is able to endure when time hasn't expired. However, many people begin to wonder if their faith worked now the time has expired. For instance, you are believing God for a job offer. You have been to an interview with many others for that same job. You were told that if you don’t hear from us by this date it means you were not selected. As long as the date has not expired, it is easier to trust that what you have believed is what will come to pass. Then comes the last day and still, you've not been called. What will you do? You will continue to trust because God can do anything at any time including this last hour. Then evening comes, and the day is over – no call or email from the company. What will you do? There is a high probability that you will conclude that it did not work. This is the point time defeats your faith.\n\nRemember – God is not limited by time. Don’t you think God can do what He has said after the expiry of man’s date and time?\n\nCan you trust God when the time has expired? This is what happened to Abraham. He and Sarah had to believe in God when their time of childbearing was over. By faith, Sarah received the strength to conceive and delivered a child when she was past age because she judged Him faithful who has promised (Hebrews 11:11).\n\nPrecious One, there will be certain days time will tell you that it is over for you or it is not possible or it is too late. Don’t believe in time; believe in God.\n\n2. Space: Another enemy of faith is space. By space, I mean room, opportunity, etc. There are times space may try our faith. For instance, in Luke 5:17-20, a move of faith is recorded there. It is recorded that Jesus was teaching on a certain day and multitudes from all over Galilee, Judaea and Jerusalem had come to hear him. Some friends wanted a colleague to be healed, and believing that Jesus could heal their friend, carried him on a stretcher to Jesus’ meeting. When they got to the meeting place, the room and the compound and beyond were full of people and there was no way of bringing their friend close to Jesus. There was no space for their faith and friend. What did they do? They created their own space. They went to the rooftop, rid it open and lowered the sick man down. When Jesus saw their faith, everything else Jesus was doing ceased and His attention was focused on this faith in action. He said to the sick man, “rise up, pick up your bed and go home.” The sick man rose up and he could walk. He took his bed and went home. Glory to God.\nPrecious One, never let anyone tell you there are no opportunities here for you when God has said there are. Tell them you are able to create one if there is none. Let no man tell you that the spaces available are all booked by others. Tell them you came with your own space or somebody has changed his/her mind. Glory to God.\n\n3. Matter: The third enemy is matter (the material), and the commonest matter (or material) we can think about is money. Often, the absence of money has made the faith of many go off-track. God spoke to you but He did not give you the money to accomplish it. So you are frustrated? No way. Maybe what is required to fulfil His word is already embedded in the word of faith that came to you. If your faith (or confidence) is truly founded on the spoken word of God, you don’t need money. God didn’t need money to create the heavens and the earth. He wouldn’t need your bank account to fulfil or materialize what He has accomplished in you. Remember, He sets the end before the beginning. Meaning, by the time God spoke to you, He had accomplished it. Just keep going by your faith.\nSupposing it is a new year and you are planning your year regarding the things you would like to accomplish. Are you going to project based on your historical financial data or what you and God can do jointly? Will you project based on your current income stream or you can trust that you are not limited by your current paycheck? Some brethren’s faith is being curtailed by what they have and what they do not have. Your relationship with God will always compensate for what you did not receive genetically or materially. With God (or jointly with God), all things are possible. Glory to God!\n\nPrecious One, when your faith stands trial, don’t stagger at the word of God. Rather be strong in faith. In what way can a believer be strong in the God-kind of faith? Abraham had to wait for 25 years to see the materialization of God’s word in his life. During this period, he strengthened his faith by going back from time to time, so God could repeat to him the same word of faith (Genesis 15:4; Genesis 17:16; Genesis 21:!2). God is not weary to repeat to us the same thing He has said about us to help us build strong confidence in Him. Any time God repeats His word to us, it is fresh and our faith in Him is renewed.",

The proof of confidence is in the actions we take based on the word we have received. This is why faith without action or work is a dead one. I heard the story of a man who was challenged by a TV host show, to do his craziest art ever. This man asked the TV host, “will you believe if I told you I can walk on ropes over a waterfall?” The TV host confessed that it is not possible. This man went ahead and did it. Again, this guy asked the TV host if he would believe him to push a wheelbarrow with a huge stone on the same rope over the same waterfall. The TV host said, “I think you are capable of doing what the mind cannot believe”. This man went ahead and did it, with a wheelbarrow and a huge stone in it. After the incident, in an interview, this man asked the TV host, “will you believe it if I tell you I can do it again”. “Sure, of course. I can bet my head on it and have no concern”, the TV host replied. This man then made him an offer – this time he wants to put the TV host in the wheelbarrow and push it on that rope over that waterfall. The TV host said it loud and clear – No way!\n\nI thought this guy had proven his capability more than enough to secure the trust of the TV host. Why is this TV host guy afraid even though he was willing to bet his head on this final expedition? Precious One, talk can be cheap without action. Faith without confident action is a lifeless one. This is why Jesus will have to tell the sick at all times, “rise up and walk”. Thus, if you believe in Him [Jesus] and that He can heal you, then take the initiative to walk or do what you couldn’t do before. In the process of taking steps, what needs to materialize will.
